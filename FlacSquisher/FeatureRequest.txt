    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ts553s52.aspx
Create "Console" window containing a log of activities
Use Win32 API instead of VC++ runtimes
Add icons
Set "Encoder Options" settings based on current selected encoder and CLI options

Done
=============
Ogg Vorbis encoding using OggEnc2
Multi-threaded/multi-process encoding
MP3 encoding using LAME
Load configuration from file
----Alpha 0.0.0.1 released----
Put encoder selection in Options window
Progress bar
Main thread no longer becomes unresponsive waiting for other threads to finish (not using "join()" anymore)
Make only the last thread finished re-enable the encode button
----Alpha 0.0.2 released----
Added version number to title bar
Added option to hide command windows
Added window to choose encoder options
    LAME options follow official LAME UI Guidelines
    http://lame.sourceforge.net/lame_ui_example.php
Added thread lock on file count (fixes lower-than-expected count)
Changed included version of LAME encoder from 3.97 to 3.98
----Beta 0.0.3 released----
Updated error message when config file isn't properly loaded on startup to be more user-friendly
Fixed crash when source directory does not exist
Changed "Online Help" and other links to go to default browser rather than IE
----Beta 0.3.1 released----
Implemented version check system
Now ignores files with certain extensions -- by default: txt, jpg, log, pdf
Optionally copy all ignored files to the new directory without modifying them
Set maximum number of threads to a very high value (65535), due to the increasing number of cores in modern CPUs
Fixed a bug where opening the Options window, and not the Encoder Options window, reset the encoder and options
Changed included version of LAME encoder from 3.98 to 3.98.2
Included libsndfile 1.0.18pre22a, so future versions can go directly from FLAC to MP3
----Beta 0.3.2 released----
MP3 tagging (OggEnc2 already carries over FLAC tags)
Fixed bug that caused command windows to show briefly even if "Hide command windows" option was selected
----Beta 0.4.0 released----
Fixed bug that caused encoding process to not commence
----Beta 0.4.1 released----
Added png to the list of extensions ignored by default
Made changes necessary to compile with "/clr:safe" rather than "/clr:pure"
Changed hard-coded backslashes in path code to "DirectorySeparatorChar"
----Beta 0.4.2 released----
In case the input file is a FLAC file without an extension, add .ogg or .mp3 on the end
Clarified empty directory error messages
----Beta 0.4.3 released----
Convert code to Visual C++ to Visual C#
Update threading code so it won't crash in Mono
----Beta 0.5.0 released----
Fixed progress bar label showing inaccurate progress
When copying files, don't try to encode them as well
Updated OggEnc binary to libVorbis 1.2.2 (oggenc is still v2.85): multichannel behavior is improved
----Beta 0.5.1 released----
Seperated extension ignore functionality from extension copy functionality
Updated OggEnc binary to libVorbis 1.2.3: Fixes issue with FLAC tags not transferring to Ogg Vorbis files
----Beta 0.5.2 released----
Import album artist and disc number tags during LAME encoding
Import embedded album art during LAME encoding
Hard-code correct information into the About window
Add cue to the list of extensions ignored by default
Changed OggEnc binary to generic compile; some users may be using old processors
Updated LAME binary to version compiled with Intel Compiler 11.1.046
Updated FLAC binary to version compiled with Intel Compiler 11.1.046
----Beta 0.5.3 released----
Moved config file from the executable directory to the AppData directory, to avoid permissions issues
Expanded the size of the progress bar
Updated LAME binary to 3.98.3
----Beta 0.5.4 released----
About window now takes version information from parameters passed in from main window class
For MP3 encoding, ignore Album Artist and Disc Number until the LAME bug is fixed that prevents pass-in
Include version information in Assembly fields, and read program version number from there
Updated OggEnc binary to 2.86 using libvorbis 1.3.1
Updated LAME binary to 3.98.4
----Beta 0.5.5 released----
Utilize libsndfile .dll we've already been releasing in order to encode directly from FLAC to MP3
