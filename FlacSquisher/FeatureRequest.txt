Done
=============
Ogg Vorbis encoding using OggEnc2
Multi-threaded/multi-process encoding
MP3 encoding using LAME
Load configuration from file
----Alpha 0.0.0.1 released----
Put encoder selection in Options window
Progress bar
Main thread no longer becomes unresponsive waiting for other threads to finish (not using "join()" anymore)
Make only the last thread finished re-enable the encode button
----Alpha 0.0.2 released----
Added version number to title bar
Added option to hide command windows
Added window to choose encoder options
    LAME options follow official LAME UI Guidelines
    http://lame.sourceforge.net/lame_ui_example.php
Added thread lock on file count (fixes lower-than-expected count)
Changed included version of LAME encoder from 3.97 to 3.98
----Beta 0.0.3 released----
Updated error message when config file isn't properly loaded on startup to be more user-friendly
Fixed crash when source directory does not exist
Changed "Online Help" and other links to go to default browser rather than IE
----Beta 0.3.1 released----
Implemented version check system
Now ignores files with certain extensions -- by default: txt, jpg, log, pdf
Optionally copy all ignored files to the new directory without modifying them
Set maximum number of threads to a very high value (65535), due to the increasing number of cores in modern CPUs
Fixed a bug where opening the Options window, and not the Encoder Options window, reset the encoder and options
Changed included version of LAME encoder from 3.98 to 3.98.2
Included libsndfile 1.0.18pre22a, so future versions can go directly from FLAC to MP3
----Beta 0.3.2 released----
MP3 tagging (OggEnc2 already carries over FLAC tags)
Fixed bug that caused command windows to show briefly even if "Hide command windows" option was selected
----Beta 0.4.0 released----
Fixed bug that caused encoding process to not commence
----Beta 0.4.1 released----
Added png to the list of extensions ignored by default
Made changes necessary to compile with "/clr:safe" rather than "/clr:pure"
Changed hard-coded backslashes in path code to "DirectorySeparatorChar"
----Beta 0.4.2 released----
in case the input file is a FLAC file without an extension, add .ogg or .mp3 on the end
